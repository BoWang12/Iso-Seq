# Maize PacBio Iso-Seq

This is the GFF3 file of all the high-quality full-length isoforms that generated from maize PacBio Iso-Seq data, which has been
published by Wang et al., Nature Communications, 2016.

This study has several targets:
 1) To set up the protocal of bacoding stratgy, which can sequence many different tissues in one smart cell;
 2) To capture the as many full-length isoforms as possible in maize transcriptome;
 3) To study alternative splicing in maize transcriptome;
 4) Using full-length isoforms to facilitate genome annotation;
