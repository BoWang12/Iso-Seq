# Maize PacBio Iso-Seq

This is ftp link (ftp://brie4.cshl.edu/pub/pacbio_maize_B73/) for of all the high-quality full-length isoforms that generated from maize PacBio Iso-Seq data, which has been published by Wang et al., Nature Communications, 2016.

This study has several targets:

 1) To set up the protocal of barcoding strategy, which can sequence many different samples in one smart cell;

 2) To capture as many full-length isoforms as possible in maize transcriptome;
 
 3) To study alternative splicing in maize transcriptome;
 
 4) Use full-length isoforms to facilitate genome annotation.
